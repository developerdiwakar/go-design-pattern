# Design Patterns in GO Programming

There are three main categories of Design Patterns.
- Creational Design Patterns
- Structural Design Patterns
- Behavioral Design Patterns

## Creational 
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Some commonly used Creational design patterns:
 - **Factory Method** 
    - **Concept:** Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to intantiate.
    - **Use Case:** When you want to create objects of different related classes based on specific criteria.
    - **Benefits:** Promotes loose coupling, allows for subclass control over object creation, hides concrete implementation.
    - **Drawbacks:** Introduces an extra layer of abstraction, might require subclass proliferation.
 - **Abstract Factory**
